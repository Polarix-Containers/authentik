# authentik

![Build, scan & push](https://github.com/Polarix-Containers/authentik/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

### Features & usage
- Unprivileged image: you should check your volumes' permissions (eg `/data`), default UID/GID is 200001.
- ⚠️ Unlike upstream's container, this image does **not** use FIPS cryptography.
- ⚠️ This image has only been tested to work with OIDC and Forward Auth. All other authentication methods are untested.
- ⚠️ Keberos will not fully work like upstream, since Alpine Linux does not allow for `krb5` and `heimdal` to be installed at the same time.

### Licensing

- Authentik is licensed under a combination of different licenses. See upstream's notice [here](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/blob/main/LICENSE).
